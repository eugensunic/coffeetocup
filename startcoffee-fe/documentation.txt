STATES
------
- states are managing data which go to the database
- variables which contain snapshot state data are never mutated (immutable) on state change! use them wisely, preferably,
immediately above the code which will consume them
example:
    const originState = this.store.selectSnapshot(CoffeeOriginStates.inputFormOrigin);
    
    this.coffeeSubmitService
      .getCoffeeResult(URL.apiCoffeeBrewResult, { params: { country: originState.country } })
      .subscribe(x => (this.coffeeOriginJson = this.combineBrewAndAttributes(x)));

SERVICES
--------
services are managing XHR request and communication via components

BOOLEAN METHODS
--------
- should start with an is prefix and should check valid, example: isValid, not isInvalid but !isValid() when
checking the condition

INTERFACE
--------
- should contain method signature when called and implementation attached in a class




USERS EXPLANATION
-----------------
- undefined argument represents the currently logged in user
- urlProps['id'] argument means that we are on some other user profile

 this.userProfileService.getUserSettingsData(URL.settingsBasic, {
          params: { otherUserId: undefined }
        })
 this.userProfileService.getUserSettingsData(URL.settingsBasic, {
          params: { otherUserId: urlProps['id'] }
        })
